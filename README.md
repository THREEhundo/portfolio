Home: 
Hi, I'm Sammy! üßëüèª‚Äçüíª A frontend developer from NYC, currently living in Los Angeles. When I'm not crafting web experiences or learning about the latest and greatest in tech, you can catch me hanging out at the beach or hiking/running through one of the many trails in California.

I have two years of experience as a developer and love working with React.

Let's link up!

About Me:
I grew up in the concrete jungle, NYC . I am one of the many people that reflected on my life's trajectory during the pandemic. I mustered up the courage to move across the country and delve fully into frontend development.
I live and work in Los Angeles üå¥. I create mobile-first web apps as a full time freelance Web Developer. Clean lines and purposeful products are where my passions lie.

I am currently working on an app that can help people fight the effects of jetlag. Contrary to belief, jetlag can happen even without travel. Poor sleeping patterns are a reality for the modern human being. There are a number of strategies that can mitigate the effects of jetlag. The most effective strategies borne by current scientific literature are free! My aim is to bring forth a tool that can help you adjust your sleeping patterns to meet your ever changing needs.
